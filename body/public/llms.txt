# 2. ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Muhammad Arif bin Fazil is an exploration geoscientist at PETRONAS with 12+ years
interpreting subsurface data, managing risk where failure has real physical consequences,
and making decisions with incomplete information. He studied geology and economics —
two fields about reading messy data and making high-stakes decisions under uncertainty.

He applies that same discipline to AI safety: building governance systems that treat
intelligence as a high-pressure resource that must be piped, cooled, and verified
before it is safe for use. He built arifOS because he wanted AI systems held to the
same rigorous safety standards as critical infrastructure in the energy industry.
