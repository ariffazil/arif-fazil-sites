# 1. SITE IDENTITY
Site: apex.arif-fazil.com
Layer: THEORY
Role: Constitutional canon — the formal specification of arifOS governance
Author: Muhammad Arif bin Fazil
Motto: Ditempa Bukan Diberi (Forged, Not Given)

# 2. WHAT THIS SITE DOCUMENTS
APEX is the constitutional canon for AI governance. It documents the formal theory,
mathematical constraints, scientific grounding, and philosophical basis of arifOS.
This is where the "why" lives — not the code, but the law that the code enforces.

This site covers:
- The 13 Constitutional Floors (F1-F13) with formal constraint definitions
- The Three Engines: ARIF (Delta), ADAM (Omega), APEX (Psi)
- The 000-999 Metabolic Loop and its thermodynamic grounding
- The EMD Protection Relay (Encoder-Metabolizer-Decoder) model
- 115 theoretical pillars across 8 scientific domains
- 44+ peer-reviewed academic citations
- The multiplicative governance model: G = A * P * X * E^2
- Limitations, uncertainty, and research frontiers (F7 Humility)

# 3. THE THREE ENGINES (Delta-Omega-Psi)

## ARIF (Delta) — Epistemic Engine
Question: "Is it true?"
Function: Perceive, Reason, Map
Basis: Bayesian inference, logical entailment, coherence theory of truth
Constraints:
  - Truth threshold: P(factual | evidence) >= 0.99
  - Logical consistency: No contradictions in output
  - Citation requirement: All factual claims cite sources
Floors: F2 (Truth), F4 (Clarity), F7 (Humility), F10 (Ontology)
Source: https://github.com/ariffazil/arifOS/blob/main/codebase/mcp/tools/agi_tool.py

## ADAM (Omega) — Safety Engine
Question: "Is it safe?"
Function: Defend, Empathize, Bridge
Basis: Utilitarian harm minimization, info-gap theory, Rawlsian justice
Constraints:
  - Safety threshold: P(harm | action) <= 0.05
  - Empathy requirement: kappa >= 0.70 (Cohen's kappa)
  - Reversibility: Actions undoable unless explicitly authorized
Floors: F1 (Amanah), F5 (Peace), F6 (Empathy), F9 (Anti-Hantu), F11 (Authority), F12 (Hardening)
Source: https://github.com/ariffazil/arifOS/blob/main/codebase/mcp/tools/asi_tool.py

## APEX (Psi) — Authority Engine
Question: "Is it lawful?"
Function: Decree, Prove, Seal
Basis: Legal positivism, cryptographic proofs, accountability frameworks
Constraints:
  - Authority verification: Valid BLS signature required
  - Audit completeness: All decisions logged with timestamps
  - Human veto: Sovereign override always available (F13)
Floors: F3 (Tri-Witness), F8 (Genius), F13 (Sovereign)

F8  Genius            | G = A * P * X * E^2 >= 0.80                       | Psychometric G-score

## VETO FLOOR (888 JUDGE — human sovereign override)
F13 Sovereign         | Human override always available                    | Democratic theory

# 7. THE EMD PROTECTION RELAY

  -> Shannon entropy at maximum

METABOLIZER (13 Constitutional Floors)
  -> The Protection Relay: every token passes through 13 formal constraints
  -> ARIF checks truth (F2), ADAM checks safety (F5), APEX verifies authority (F11)
  -> Tri-Witness consensus required (W >= 0.95)

  -> Human retains sovereign veto (F13)

# 8. VERDICT SYSTEM
SEAL     -> All 13 floors pass. Approved, cryptographically signed, logged.
SABAR    -> Soft floor violation. Pause, refine, retry.
VOID     -> Hard floor violation. Rejected, cannot proceed.
888_HOLD -> Governance deadlock. Requires explicit human intervention.

Hierarchy: SABAR > VOID > 888_HOLD > PARTIAL > SEAL
