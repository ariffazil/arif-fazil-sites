# arifOS Documentation — Constitutional Governance Kernel

> Complete technical documentation for arifOS: a thermodynamic constitutional governance framework that wraps any LLM (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama) and enforces lawful, audited, reversible behavior through 13 floors and Trinity architecture.

arifOS is a governance kernel, not a model. It sits between users and AI systems, validating every output against 13 constitutional floors before release. Truth must cool before it rules.
